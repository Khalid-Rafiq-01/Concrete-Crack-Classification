# Concrete-Crack-Classification

Using custom based CNNs and Pretrained encoders for concrete crack classification. 
Pretraining is performed on MoblileNet V2 model in two ways:
  1. Feature Extraction 
  2. Fine tuning with lower learning rate.

Creating confusion matrix to compare all the different models.
Testing the pretrained model on an online image from the internet.
