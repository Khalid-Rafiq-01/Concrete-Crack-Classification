# Concrete-Crack-Classification

**Using custom based CNNs and Pretrained encoders for concrete crack classification.**

Custom CNN Model   {File name = Crack_Classification_Custom_CNN}

Pretraining is performed on MoblileNet V2 model in two ways:  {File name = Crack_Classification_Pre_Trained_Model}

  1. Feature Extraction 
  2. Fine tuning with lower learning rate.

Creating confusion matrix to compare all the different models.

Testing the pretrained model on an online image from the internet. {Filename = Testing_Crack_Classification_Models}
